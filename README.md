## Tips for Better Results

- **Be Specific**: Provide unique details about the person
- **Include Achievements**: Mention notable works, awards, or characteristics
- **Add Context**: Include time periods, locations, or fields of work
- **Be Distinctive**: The more unique the information, the better the AI can guess
- **Try Different Angles**: If the first guess is wrong, the AI learns and improves
- **Explore Family Trees**: Click on family member names to discover related famous people
- **Start Fresh**: You can begin a new game anytime with different information

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Error**: Make sure both Gemini and Google Maps API keys are set in `config.py` or as environment variables
- **Google Maps Not Loading**: Ensure you have enabled "Maps JavaScript API" and "Geocoding API" in Google Cloud Console
- **Port Already in Use**: If port 8000 is busy, modify the port in `app.py`
- **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection for API calls
- **Static Files Not Loading**: Ensure the `/static` directory exists and contains all frontend files
- **Model Errors**: The app now uses `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` - ensure your API key has access to this model
- **Image Loading Issues**: Images are fetched from Wikipedia using Beautiful Soup - check your internet connection
- **Dependency Issues**: Make sure to install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **CORS Issues**: Wikipedia images use a CORS proxy (images.weserv.nl) for proper display
- **Map Display Issues**: Check browser console for Google Maps API errors and verify API key restrictions
- **Billing Issues**: Google Maps APIs require billing to be enabled even for free tier usage
